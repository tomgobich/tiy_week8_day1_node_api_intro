# Instagram Clone

##### The Iron Yard - Week 7, Day 4

For this assignment we were to create an Instagram clone. The backend for this assignment was provided to us.
Our goal was to create at least three views:
- Home page - showing all the posted images
- Detail page - showing the details for a single selected image
- Add page - allowing the user to add a new image

We were to also allow the users to 'like' an image, and to persist the like count via the database.


### Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS / SASS
- JavaScript
